    Continuous Actor Critic Network.
    The actor and critic are both feed forward neural networks.
    They share a common set of layers.
    The actor takes the state/observation and outputs the mean and standard deviation of the action distribution.
    The standard deviation is processed to stay in a predefined range and to ensure that it is always positive.
    The critic takes the state/observation and outputs the value estimate.
